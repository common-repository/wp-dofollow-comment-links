The plugin automatically makes all the comment links to your own domain dofollow, while all external links remain nofollow.
 
== Description ==
 
Simple plugin that will improve your onsite SEO a bit and make all links from the comment section dofollow, if they point to your own domain. Other links that point to external websites will remain nofollow. WP DoFollow Comment Links don't have any configorations - simply activate it and that's all.

It also works with Wordpress installations that reside in a subfolder. For example, Wordpress installed in example.com/blog, separate from the main website example.com.
